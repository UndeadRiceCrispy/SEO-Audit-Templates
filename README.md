## 1. Technical SEO Audit

This section focuses on the technical foundation of the website, ensuring search engines can efficiently crawl, index, and render your content.

| Status | Check | Area | Notes & Recommendations |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ‚òê | **Crawlability & Indexing** | | |
| ‚òê | Review `robots.txt` for unintended blocks. | Indexing | Ensure no important pages or resources are disallowed. |
| ‚òê | Check XML Sitemap for errors and formatting. | Indexing | Sitemap should be submitted to Google Search Console and be free of errors. |
| ‚òê | Check Google's index status (`site:domain.com` search). | Indexing | Look for major discrepancies between indexed pages and actual pages. |
| ‚òê | Identify and resolve crawl errors (Google Search Console). | Crawlability | Fix 404s, server errors (5xx), and other crawl anomalies. |
| ‚òê | **Site Architecture & Performance** | | |
| ‚òê | Ensure an `HTTPS` certificate is correctly installed. | Security | Site should be secure and redirect HTTP to HTTPS. |
| ‚òê | Analyze URL structure for clarity and SEO-friendliness. | Architecture | URLs should be simple, readable, and include keywords where appropriate. |
| ‚òê | Test mobile-friendliness and usability. | Mobile | Use Google's Mobile-Friendly Test. Check for viewport issues. |
| ‚òê | Analyze site speed with Google PageSpeed Insights. | Performance | Aim for a "Good" Core Web Vitals score. Optimize images, leverage caching. |
| ‚òê | Check for broken internal and external links. | User Experience | Use a crawler like Screaming Frog to find and fix broken links. |
| ‚òê | **Structured Data** | | |
| ‚òê | Validate existing Schema markup. | Rich Snippets | Use the Rich Results Test to ensure Schema is implemented correctly. |
| ‚òê | Identify opportunities for new Schema (e.g., FAQ, Product). | Rich Snippets | Implement relevant structured data to enhance SERP appearance. |

## 2. On-Page SEO Audit

This section analyzes individual page elements to ensure they are optimized for target keywords and user intent.

| Status | Check | Area | Notes & Recommendations |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ‚òê | **Content & Keywords** | | |
| ‚òê | Check for duplicate or thin content issues. | Content Quality | Use a tool like Siteliner or Copyscape. Consolidate or improve low-quality pages. |
| ‚òê | Ensure content aligns with search intent for target keywords. | Keyword Targeting | Is the content informational, transactional, or navigational? Does it match what ranks? |
| ‚òê | Analyze title tags for optimization (length, keyword placement). | Meta Tags | Keep titles under 60 characters. Place the primary keyword near the beginning. |
| ‚òê | Analyze meta descriptions for compelling copy. | Meta Tags | While not a ranking factor, good descriptions improve click-through rates. Keep under 160 characters. |
| ‚òê | Check for proper use of header tags (H1, H2, etc.). | Content Structure | There should be only one H1 per page. Use H2s for main sections. |
| ‚òê | **Other On-Page Elements** | | |
| ‚òê | Audit images for `alt` text and file size. | Image SEO | `Alt` text should be descriptive. Compress images to improve page speed. |
| ‚òê | Review internal linking structure and anchor text. | Internal Linking | Link to relevant pages using descriptive anchor text. Ensure important pages have sufficient internal links. |

## 3. Off-Page SEO Audit

This section evaluates the website's authority and reputation on the web, primarily focusing on its backlink profile.

| Status | Check | Area | Notes & Recommendations |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ‚òê | **Backlink Profile** | | |
| ‚òê | Analyze total number of referring domains. | Authority | Focus on the quality and relevance of linking domains, not just quantity. |
| ‚òê | Review anchor text distribution. | Link Relevance | Anchor text should be natural and varied. An over-optimization can be a red flag. |
| ‚òê | Identify and disavow toxic or spammy backlinks. | Link Health | Use tools like Ahrefs or Semrush to assess backlink toxicity. Submit a disavow file if necessary. |
| ‚òê | **Competitive Analysis** | | |
| ‚òê | Analyze top competitors' backlink profiles. | Opportunity Analysis | Identify high-quality domains linking to competitors but not to you (Link Gap). |
| ‚òê | **Brand Presence** | | |

| ‚òê | Review social media presence and engagement. | Social Signals | Ensure social profiles are active and consistently represent the brand. |
